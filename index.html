                    <h2>Who was him?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nikola Tesla, of serbian parents, was born the 10th of July of 1856, in Smijlian the late Austro-Hungarian Empire. His
                        father, Milutin, was a Serbian Orthodox priest; and his mother, Duka, was a housewife who had a talent for making home
                        craft tools. Tesla inherited his eidetic memory from his mother. He had four siblings, three older and one younger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During 1873, Tesla got Cholera and was near death many times. His father, desolated due to his son’s illness, promised
                        to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1881, he worked at a Telegraph Company in Budapest where he was the Chief Electrician. A year later, he moved to Paris
                        in order to work for the Continental Edison Company for two years. Then, Tesla moved to New York to work in another
                        division of Edison´s Company. In 1885 when Edison didn’t pay him what was previously agreed, Nikola quit his job.

                    <p>
                        In 1884 Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing company; where he developed his idea for an alternating
                        current electric system. Later, he was abandoned by his investors due to a fight with Edison about which system was
                        safer and better. This “war of currents” will extend onto the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company where
                        Nikola will later work.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        A year later, at the Universal Exposition of Chicago, Tesla and Westinghouse presented the alternate current system to the
                        public that was also used to illuminate the exhibition.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The final triumph over Edison’s direct current happened during 1985, when the first hydroelectric power plant was built.
                        After that, the alternate current was used to electrify the world.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Nikola Tesla loved science but dislike business, and because of that many of his inventions were not patented or, simply
                        stolen.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Despite the many contributions to humanity he made, Tesla died alone and poor in a room in the New Yorker Hotel in 1943
                        because he wanted electricity to be free.
