                <p>
                    In 1891, Tesla was given the US patent no. 447,921 for its alternating current generator.
                </p>
               <p>
                    For that time, the generator meant a more efficient way of providing electricity at a lower cost. The reason of this, is
                    that it allows the possibility of transporting electricity over long distances.

                <h4>Radio</h4>
                <p>
                    Marconi was not the inventor of the radio. Tesla already had a basic design for a radio system in 1892. However, it was
                    not until 1898 that he patented and demonstrated his system at an exhibition in New York. He did it by using a
                    remote-controlled boat that received radio waves through an antenna.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nikola and Marconi had a legal battle over the patent. In 1943, 6 months after his death, the United States Supreme
                    Court ruled in favor of Tesla, giving him the patents related to the invention and, declaring Marconi's patents invalid.

                <h4>Tesla Coil</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1891, the inventor registered an electrical transformer known as the Tesla coil. His idea was to transmit electricity
                    without the need for cables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, not only this type of coils are used in high tension towers or in scientific laboratories but also, in the
                    show business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also possible to create homemade coils.

                <h4>Neon sign</h4>
                <p>
                    Tesla did not create neon or fluorecent lights but, he contributed to their improvement. He used existing technology to
                put together signs with words and designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, these signs are used to identify places such as hotels and bars.

                <h4>Shadowgraph or x-rays</h4>
                <p>
                    X-rays were created by Whilhelm Rontgen in 1895. However, Tesla made an improvement on the invention by making the
                    images sharper. This also led to his collaboration in discovering the effects of x-rays and how they can be used to
                    improve human health.
